# CatCounter
This is a small project I made back when I was first learning programming in 2023. I wanted a way to count how many times over the last few months I'd used the cat emoticon ':3' in my Discord conversations with a friend in each individual day, for curiosity's sake. However, Discord's search feature doesn't allow you to copy and paste the number of results for some reason, so I made this code for using Tesseract OCR to automate the process and output a table on a txt file.

Just change the file path for tesseract, the "filename"(.txt), the two "name"s and the "word" variable.
